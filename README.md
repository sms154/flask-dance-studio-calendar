# Salsa Latina Dance Studio Bookings Calendar

## Description
You can hire a dance studio at Salsa Latina but they don't have a booking system and there's no calendar on their website that displays when the studio is available or booked. 
There are however, iCal links available that you can subscribe to and see the live bookings.

My friend that I train with regulary doesn't have an Apple device so I created this website so that users can view the bookings and there is also button that directs the user to the studio booking form.
